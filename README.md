# Net Practice - A Hands-On Networking Exercise

**Net Practice** is a practical project designed to introduce the fundamentals of networking. It focuses on understanding TCP/IP addressing, configuring small-scale networks, and solving network-related problems.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In this project, you will complete 10 levels of networking exercises. Each level presents a non-functioning network diagram with specific issues to resolve. Your goal is to configure the network correctly to make it functional.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Training Interface
- **Access:** Run the `index.html` file from the downloaded project materials to open the training interface in a web browser.
- **Modes:**
  - **Practice Mode:** Enter your login to practice.
  - **Correction Mode:** Leave the login field empty to access the correction mode.
- **Tools:**
  - **Check Again:** Verify your configuration at any time.
  - **Get My Config:** Export your configuration for submission and review.

### Levels
- Solve 10 levels of network configuration problems.
- Each level unlocks after successfully completing the previous one.
- Logs are available to help debug and understand errors.

### Key Concepts
- TCP/IP addressing.
- Configuring routers and devices in a network.
- Debugging and solving network connectivity issues.

## üîß How to Use

1. Download the project materials from the assigned page.
2. Extract the files and navigate to the folder.
3. Run `index.html` in your web browser to open the training interface.
4. Complete each level by fixing the network issues and verifying your configuration using **Check Again**.
5. Export your configuration using **Get My Config** before proceeding to the next level.

### Submission
- Turn in 10 configuration files (one for each level) in your Git repository.
- Ensure each file is correctly named and placed at the root of your repository.
- Enter your login in the interface before exporting configurations.

## üß™ Testing and Defense
- During defense:
  - You will be required to complete 3 random levels.
  - You will have limited time to solve each level.
- External tools are not allowed during evaluation, except for basic calculators like `bc`.

## üìú Notes
- A strong understanding of TCP/IP addressing is essential.
- This project is part of the 42 curriculum and is designed for educational purposes.
